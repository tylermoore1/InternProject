Internationally - how are they handling insurance (which countries are ahead) 

Germany: 

software is programmed to hurt the least amount of people (priority over animals & property) 

issues with one person in car vs one outside -- who is killed vs saved 

black box in car 

if vehicle driving within legal limits, then it will be the manufacturer's fault 

^ advanced and autonomous the car, ^ responsible manufacturer is legally 

 

What is going to happen 

fewer accidents doesn't mean drop policies --> b/c each accident costs more 

what point do the repair costs increase for industry vs decrease 

 

Background & Culture with Autonomous Vehicles 

Millenials use uber & lyft 

next generations wont know how to drive 

housing market changes bc lack of garages 

UPS & FedEx cutting delivery cars 

lack of parking lots, signs, traffic lights 

 

 

What happens if we don't change 

Lost Policy Revenues 

some money is saved from having to pay for fewer claims 

autonomous cars will be safer than human-driven cars so policies will be cheaper 

money saved from claims < money lost from cheaper policies 

Potential Opportunities 

Cyber security 

vehicle theft 

'ransomware' (holding vehicle hostage, rendering it unusable if payments are not made on time) 

hijacking / hacking into vehicles for remote control 

identity theft & misuse of personal information 

cars will be connected to personal information and will most likely have phone Bluetooth access 

Product liability insurance 

policies to cover potential manufacturer issues  

Software: full memory, algorithm failure, bugs, Wi-Fi issues, communication failure 

Hardware: sensor failure, camera issues, circuit failure, radar 

Insuring against infrastructure problems 

biggest policies payers will be manufacturers -- shift focus from individuals to manufacturer companies  

 

Next Steps for Progressive 

Working in partnership with manufacturers  

Getting there first will allow a relationship to be secured with the manufacturer 

Manufacturers will most likely offer packages to buying customers (car with insurance). 

This insurance will be specialized for the autonomous car taking care of liability / responsibility issues 

Pre prepared plan of Progressive with the manufacturers will make it easy sales as the insurance come with the autonomous vehicle  

Jumpstart on new project modeling 

Organizing and figuring out policies and packages 

Creating new distribution channels

Tunneling: tesla bringing underground roads to avoid traffic, tracks underneath the city carry the cars with no speed limit 

shrinking diameter of roads to fit more cars in due to reduced accidents so you don't need the extra room 

More driving will occur, traffic will get worse when you reach the point that cars are cheaper --> buses and trains will alternate to cars = more traffic congestion => tunneling
