### Steps to get Udacity Term 3 sim running on mac machines
  1.) Download term 3 sim executable: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases
  2.) Copy and paste the CarND-Path-Planning-Project-P11 repo into a different folder because when you compile the files, it will create more files. We do not want these in the repo because everyone has to compile the files for the first time running on your local machine. 
  3.) Follow instructions on the README.md file from the CarND-Path-Planning-Project-P11 repo to set up the self driving car
