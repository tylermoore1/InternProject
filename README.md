# Repo for internship project

### See the Wiki tab for the latest status on the project.

We are using Udacity's car simulator as the main framework. If necessary, CARLA is our fallback.

### Goal of this Repo

This repo's main intent is to compare how safe autonomous vehicles are compared to human drivers. The autonomous scripts found in this repo were not made by us. We downloaded them from outside sources in order to test their software. Each folder either represents a different autonomous solution or data to test if these solutions are safer than a manual driver.

### Steps to get Udacity Term 1 sim running on mac/windows machines
  1.) Download unity: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
  2.) Download Udacity's self driving car sim repository from git and follow instructions: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim
  3.) Download Udacity's self driving car repository from git: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car
  4.) Download Anaconda in order to run autonomous scripts:https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux
  5.) Use Anaconda to run these autonomous scripts from git: https://github.com/naokishibuya/car-behavioral-cloning
  
### Steps to get Udacity Term 3 sim running on mac machines
  1.) Download term 3 sim executable: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases
  2.) Copy and paste the CarND-Path-Planning-Project-P11 repo into a different folder because when you compile the files, it will create more files. We do not want these in the repo because everyone has to compile the files for the first time running on your local machine. 
  3.) Follow instructions on the README.md file from the CarND-Path-Planning-Project-P11 repo to set up the self driving car
